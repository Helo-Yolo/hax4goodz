# Volunteer Impact Tracker

This Python script provides a basic implementation of a system to track and measure the impact of volunteer activities.

## Introduction

The Volunteer Impact Tracker is a simple console-based application to log volunteer activities and calculate their overall impact.

## Installation

To run this script, you will need Python 3 installed on your system. No additional libraries are required.

## Usage

1. Start the script in your terminal or command prompt:
2. Follow the prompts to enter the name, number of hours, and impact score for each volunteer activity.
3. To finish logging activities and see the total impact, type `exit` when prompted for an activity name.
4. The total volunteer hours and impact score will be displayed.
5. The activities will be saved to `activities.json` in the same directory as the script.

## Development

This script is a prototype and is intended to be expanded with additional features such as:
- A database for persistent storage.
- A web or desktop-based user interface.
- More sophisticated impact analysis algorithms.
- User authentication and management for multiple users.
